== Build a racing track

This chapter is an introductory taste of _Camel JBang_ in a motoracing context: a racing track with three sectors and a boxes area, plus racing teams that participate in practice and race sessions, each with a livery and team radio.

_Camel JBang_ is a command-line interface (CLI) that accelerates prototyping by letting developers quickly create, validate, and tweak flows without complex setups, making it perfect for rapid experimentation.

=== Build a racing track

Your town got a permit to build a racing track in the area.

This racing track will be straight forward to build:

* It will essentially consist of 3 sectors (s1, s2 and s3).
* Each sector takes a random amount of time to cover.
* After sector 3, cars may continue around the track or return to the box area depending on racecontrol directives (signals).

The box area is where teams can work on their car. When a racing car leaves boxes it will go round and round the track covering all 3 sectors in each lap. Race control can signal when all cars have to return to boxes.

Copy and paste the following into your terminal to create your racing `track.yaml` file:

[source,bash]
----
cat <<'EOF' > track.yaml
- route:
    id: sector1
    from:
      uri: file:track/s1
      parameters:
        delete: true
      steps:
        - delay:
            simple: "${random(4000,6000)}"
        - to:
            uri: file:track/s2

- route:
    id: sector2
    from:
      uri: file:track/s2
      parameters:
        delete: true
      steps:
        - delay:
            simple: "${random(4000,6000)}"
        - to:
            uri: file:track/s3

- route:
    id: sector3
    from:
      uri: file:track/s3
      parameters:
        delete: true
      steps:
        - delay:
            simple: "${random(4000,6000)}"
        - choice:
            when:
              - simple: ${variable.global:race-control} == 'boxes'
                steps:
                  - to:
                      uri: file:track/boxes
              - simple: ${variable.global:race-control} == 'last-lap'
                steps:
                  - setVariable:
                      name: global:finish-position
                      simple: ${variable.global:finish-position}++
                  - setBody:
                      simple: ${variable.global:finish-position}
                  - to:
                      uri: file:track/areas/podium
            otherwise:
              steps:
                - to:
                    uri: file:track/s1

- route:
    id: signals
    from:
      uri: file-watch
      parameters:
        path: race-control
      steps:
        - setVariable:
            name: global:race-control
            simple: ${body}

- route:
    id: init
    from:
      uri: timer:init
      parameters:
        repeatCount: 1
      steps:
        - setVariable:
            name: global:finish-position
            constant: 0
EOF
----


[NOTE]
====
Two additional routes provide flow control for the track:

- `signals`: retains in a variable the last race-control directive.
- `init`: initializes the finish position variable, used to assign the finishing position to the cars.
====

You should see the new YAML file in your file explorer:

----
📁 lab
    track.yaml
----

=== Run the track

Everyone is excited with the newly built track in the region. Open its doors so that teams can arrive and drive around it.

Copy and paste the following into your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
camel run track.yaml --background
----

NOTE: The `--background` flag runs the process detached.

You should see an output in your terminal similar to:

.Example output
----
Running Camel integration: track in background with PID: 6381
----

Notice in your file explorer a set of directories describing your physical track:

image::images/track-folders.png[width=10%]

NOTE: Make sure you unfold (down arrow *⋁* ) the track folder to display the sectors.

NOTE: The track watches the `race-control` directory, necessary for sector 3.

{empty} +

=== Set up a race control system

Any serious racing track needs a control room. Race control is responsible for communicating directives for the teams to follow, such as:

* Communicate directives to the teams, such as:
** Signal the start of a practice session
** Signal the return to boxes
** Signal the grid formation for the race
* Trigger the race start sequence and start the race

Copy and paste the following into your terminal to put together your `race-control.yaml` crew:

[source,bash]
----
cat <<'EOF' > race-control.yaml
- route:
    id: directives
    from:
      uri: direct:directive
      steps:
        - to:
            uri: file:race-control
            parameters:
              fileName: message

- route:
    id: start-sequence
    autoStartup: false
    from:
      uri: timer:start-sequence?repeatCount=1
      steps:
        - setHeader:
            name: CamelFileName
            constant: message
        - loop:
            constant: 3
            steps:
            - setBody:
                simple: light-turns-red-${exchangeProperty.CamelLoopIndex}
            - to:
                uri: file:race-control
            - delay:
                constant: 2000
        - setBody:
            constant: race-on
        - to:
            uri: file:race-control
        - loop:
            doWhile: true
            simple: ${body}
            steps:
              - poll:
                  timeout: "1000"
                  uri: file:track/grid?delete=true
              - filter:
                  simple: ${body} != null
                  steps:
                    - to:
                        uri: file:track/s1
EOF
----

NOTE: The route with id `start-sequence` has `autoStartup: false`. It needs to be started manually. Race-control will start it when the time comes to commence the race.

At this point, you should see the following sources in your file explorer:

.Example
----
📁 lab
   race-control.yaml
   track.yaml
----

Instruct personnel to get in position and turn on the race control system. Run the race control system:

[source,bash]
----
camel run race-control.yaml --background
----

Verify everyone is ready by running the command:

[source,bash]
----
camel ps
----

You should see in your terminal the following output:

.Example output
----
  PID   NAME          READY  STATUS   AGE  TOTAL  FAIL  INFLIGHT
 10513  track          1/1   Running  23s      1     0         0
 10725  race-control   1/1   Running   6s      1     0         0
----

If you see the same output, then the track is ready, race control is on duty, teams can now arrive at the track and participate on racing sessions.

Do you see the track and race control processes running? Good! Let's move on to the next step.

**Team Camel Racing** 🐪

A racing team can participate in practice and race sessions. It has a *livery* (default is 🐪, but you can configure a different one for other teams).

NOTE: The list below outlines the key responsibilities of the team:

* Unbox and deploy the racing car in boxes upon arrival at the venue
* Drive the car to the track when the practice session begins
* Radio instructions to the driver during sessions
* Pack up equipment and leave the venue at the end of the day

Copy and paste the following into your terminal to create your racing `team.yaml` file:

----

=== First private session of practice

Everyone is eager to see the new team and its ground breaking racing car. A shakedown will take place during a private session of practice.

Run the team to kickstart the day.

Copy and paste the following into your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
camel run team.yaml --name teamCamel --background
----

NOTE: The `--name teamCamel` gives this Camel process a distinct name.

After a moment, you should see the *Team Camel* deploying its beautiful racing car in their allocated pit box.

image::images/box-camel.png[width=10%]

NOTE: Click the refresh icon to refresh your project file explorer. Make sure to *unfold* the boxes directory to see the *Team Camel* car.

=== Open the track for practice

You are the race director (the boss!).

You are responsible for opening the practice session and signaling the teams to start driving around the track.

What are you waiting for?

Copy and paste the following into your terminal to issue the command to open the practice session:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd send race-control --uri direct:directive --body practice
----

NOTE: `cmd send` is a command to send a message with Camel JBang: `race-control` is the target process, `direct:directive` is the target endpoint in that process, `practice` is the body of the message to send.

Soon after, you should see *Team Camel Racing* hitting the road and lapping around the track covering all three sectors.

image::images/track-practice.jpg[width=15%]

NOTE: Make sure you unfold (down arrow *⋁* ) all sector directories to see the car lapping around the track.

Let the car cover good distance to gather all the data it needs.

=== Order return to boxes

The time window for the morning session is over. It's time to order the team to return to the boxes.

Copy and paste the following into your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd send race-control --uri direct:directive --body boxes
----

NOTE: You may need to wait for the car to get to the last sector to return to the boxes.

image::images/box-camel.png[width=10%]

Feel free to let the car go back on track to put more mileage under its belt. The more laps it covers the more data the team can collect for analysis and car improvement.

=== End of the day

It was a good day for *Team Camel Racing*, they can bring valuable data to the factory and prepare for the race event. Time to go home and get some well deserved rest.

Copy and paste the following into your terminal to tell `Team Camel Racing` to end their working day:

[source,bash]
----
camel stop teamCamel
----

NOTE: With `teamCamel`, _Camel JBang_ only stops the running process with that name.

NOTE: For convenience, we leave all the other processes (the track and race control) running to prepare for the race day.

Did *Team Camel Racing* leave the track? (did the process stop?) Good! Team Camel Racing will crunch the data they collected and will get ready for a race day event.

== Open the race event

The day of the race is here. Big crowds are expected to attend.

NOTE: Verify the processes below are still running. Use the command `camel ps`. You should see in your terminal an output similar to:

.Example output
----
 PID    NAME          READY  STATUS    AGE    TOTAL  FAIL  INFLIGHT
 10513  track          1/1   Running  22m55s    138     0         0
 10725  race-control   1/1   Running  20m34s      2     0         0
----

=== Media coverage

In preparation for such a big event we've organized commercial broadcasting for the event. Fans from all over the world will be able to watch the race live on their screens.

The code below sets up the media coverage, with multiple cameras on track, enabling the transmission of the race to multiple media channels.

NOTE: In summary, the broadcasting system: presents the track to spectators; follows cars around the different areas of the track (boxes, sectors and grid); monitors race control directives; displays crucial information to spectators.

              - log:
                  message: "[       ]        |         |         |         |"
        - filter:

        - filter:
            simple: "${body} == 'race-on'"
            steps:
            - log:
                message: "[       ]        🟢        |         |         |"
        - filter:
            simple: "${body} == 'last-lap'"
            steps:
            - log:
                message: "[       ]        |         |         |         |  Last lap!"

- route:
    id: tv-podium
    from:
      uri: file-watch
      parameters:
        path: track/areas/podium
        events: CREATE
      steps:
        - choice:
            when:
            - simple: ${body} == '1'
              steps:

                  message: "[       ]        |         |         |         | 🏁 ${header.CamelFileName} 🏆"
            otherwise:
              steps:
              - log:
                  message: "[       ]        |         |         |         | 🏁 ${header.CamelFileName}"
EOF
----

At this point, you should see the following sources in your file explorer:

.Example
----
📁 lab
   broadcast.yaml
   race-control.yaml
   team.yaml
   track.yaml
----

The broadcasting system is in place, initiate the live televised transmission:

[source,bash]
----
camel run broadcast.yaml --dev
----

NOTE: The `--dev` flag enables *development mode*, a powerful feature of Camel JBang allowing the developer to make code changes on the fly.

From this point onwards, your terminal effectively becomes your TV screen 📺 where you'll be able to watch the race unfold.

When the televised program starts, it first introduces the circuit's layout, displaying the boxes area and the 3 track sectors, as shown below:

.Example output
----
[ BOXES ]     | Sector 1| Sector 2| Sector 3|
[-------]     |---------|---------|---------|
----

NOTE: Later, *development mode* will allow us to readjust the live televised transmission while the race is ongoing.

=== Open a second Terminal

Since your current terminal is now where you will watch the televised race, open a second terminal to work in.

For the best race viewing experience, arrange your terminals horizontally. If you are using VS Code or DevSpaces, you can do this with a drag and drop operation.

Follow the steps as illustrated below:

NOTE: The example below is for DevSpaces, but the process is similar for VS Code. If using your local machine, you can equally organize your local terminals horizontally.

. *Drag and drop* the current terminal around the lower center of the area above:
+
image::images/terminals-horizontal-1.jpg[width=80%]
. Then open a *new terminal* using the menus:
+
image::images/terminals-horizontal-2.jpg[width=80%]
. *VERY IMPORTANT:* In the new terminal, make sure you switch to the `lab` directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd lab
----

You're all set to continue with the next step.

=== The racing teams

For a proper race, we need to deploy multiple participating teams.

* *Team Camel Racing*

Team Camel Racing (woot woot!), is the first to open their box.

Copy and paste the following into your terminal to deploy the team:

[source,bash]
----
camel run team.yaml --name teamCamel --background
----

* *Team Cavallino Racing*

And our big rivals (boooo!!) have arrived too, Team Cavallino Racing, with an incredible heritage and legendary wins over the course of history.

Copy and paste the following into your terminal to deploy the team:

[source,bash]
----
camel run team.yaml --name teamCavallino  --property=livery=🐎 --background
----

NOTE: With `--property` we can customize the team's livery. Here we set it to 🐎 for *Team Cavallino Racing*.

The fortunate ones with grandstands seating right in front of the pit area will see the cars in their boxes:

image::images/race-boxes.png[width=10%]

Many say watching races on TV is better, not missing out on any details:

.Example output
----
[ BOXES ]        | Sector 1| Sector 2| Sector 3|
[-------]        |---------|---------|---------|
[🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶]        |         |         |         |
[🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶]        |         |         |         |
----

TIP: Feel free to deploy as many teams as you want to make the race more exciting.

Cars are warming up and soon they'll leave boxes for the main day event to start.

=== Listen to team radio messages

Teams are constantly communicating with their drivers to provide instructions and updates. It's interesting to tune in as it gives great insights into the team's strategy and the driver's performance.

In your lower terminal, click the split button to open a new terminal side by side:

image::images/terminal-split.png[width=30%]

Your new terminal will show on the side of the first terminal:

image::images/terminal-split-result.jpg[width=80%]

In the new terminal, copy and paste the command below to listen to team radio messages:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd receive --uri file-watch:radio --only-body
----

NOTE: `cmd receive` is another powerful command from Camel JBang. Use it to consume outputs generated by Camel: `file-watch:radio` is the consumer; `--only-body` is a flag to only show the body of the message.

The output will show:

.Example output
----
Waiting for messages ...
Waiting for messages ...
----

NOTE: You see 2 lines ("waiting for messages...") because the command is capturing messages from both *Team Camel* and *Team Cavallino*.

As the event gets underway, you'll see team radio messages appearing in your terminal.

Are both teams (*Team Camel Racing* and *Team Cavallino Racing*) ready to start the race? (in boxes?) Great! It's time to start the race.

Is your radio terminal turned on? (waiting for team messages?) Nice! it'll be interesting to listen to the team messages as the race progresses.

== Grid formation and race start

The grandstands are full and crowds are excited.

We're now just moments away from the scheduled race start. As always, launching the race follows a strict protocol to ensure maximum safety and fairness for all competitors.

=== Grid formation

As the race director, you need to signal the teams to place their cars on the grid.

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd send race-control --uri direct:directive --body grid
----

NOTE: `cmd send` is a command to send a message with Camel JBang: `race-control` is the target process, `direct:directive` is the target endpoint in that process, `grid` is the body of the message to send.

Soon after, you should see teams moving their cars to their grid positions to start the race.

.Example output
----
[ BOXES ]        | Sector 1| Sector 2| Sector 3|
[-------]        |---------|---------|---------|
[🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶]        |         |         |         |
[🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶]        |         |         |         |
[       ]        |         |         |         |
[-------]- Grid -|---------|---------|---------|
[       ]        |         |         |         |
[       ] 🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶|         |         |         |
[       ] 🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶|         |         |         |
----

Teams can still work on their cars while on the grid for last minute adjustments, but will soon have to leave the grid.

=== Start the race

Mechanics and all other crew members have now left the grid. It is just the drivers and their machines on the tarmac. Engines are rumbling and spectators are waiting with great anticipation for the race to start.

The start sequence is more intricate than people think. To prevent any human error, it's been all automated. We rely on the automatic procedure to signal the start of the race.

Copy and paste the following into your terminal to start the race:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd start-route --id start-sequence race-control
----

NOTE: `cmd start-route` is a command to start a route with Camel JBang: `start-sequence` is the id of the route to start, `race-control` is the target process.

NOTE: The route `start-sequence` was originally defined with the `autoStartup: false` preventing it from starting automatically. The command above starts the route manually.

Lights will turn red and then green, indicating the start of the race:

.Example output
----
[       ]        🔴  |         |         |
[       ]        🔴  |         |         |
[       ]        🔴  |         |         |
[       ]        🟢  |         |         |
[       ]        | 🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |         |
[       ]        | 🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |         |
----

=== Watch the race unfold

You'll see the cars racing each other, from time to time you may see some overtakes happening. The example below shows a couple of laps:

.Example output
----
[       ]        | 🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |         |
[       ]        | 🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |         |
[       ]        |         | 🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |
[       ]        |         | 🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |
[       ]        |         |         | 🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |
[       ]        |         |         | 🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |
[       ]        | 🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |         |
[       ]        | 🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |         |
[       ]        |         | 🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |
[       ]        |         | 🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |
[       ]        |         |         | 🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |
[       ]        |         |         | 🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |
----

NOTE: In the example above, overtakes took place on Sector 3. Notice how *teamCavallino* overtook *teamCamel*, and in the next lap *teamCamel* got first place back.

=== Behind the Scenes: Broadcasting Upgrade

Inevitably the cost of broadcasting races isn't economically viable unless another source of income is found. For that reason we decided to upgrade the broadcast system to include advertising.

This is when the *development mode* of Camel JBang comes in handy, allowing for on-the-fly changes to the broadcast system while the live transmission is ongoing.

The command below appends code to `broadcast.yaml`. Copy and paste the following into your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
cat << 'EOF' >> broadcast.yaml

- route:
    id: tv-commercials
    from:
      uri: "direct:commercial"
      steps:
        - log:
            message: "|----------------------------------------------|"
        - log:
            message: "| ${body}"
        - log:
            message: "|----------------------------------------------|"
EOF
----

NOTE: The new route is added to the `broadcast.yaml`. It opens a new interface to display commercials.

You'll see the broadcast process react to the code changes and hot reload the routes. Your terminal output will display something like:

.Example output
----
Routes reloaded summary (total:9 started:9)
    Started tv-track-layout (timer://layout) (source: broadcast.yaml:4)
    Started tv-boxes (file-watch://track/boxes) (source: broadcast.yaml:20)
    Started tv-sector1 (file-watch://track/s1) (source: broadcast.yaml:31)
    Started tv-sector2 (file-watch://track/s2) (source: broadcast.yaml:42)
    Started tv-sector3 (file-watch://track/s3) (source: broadcast.yaml:53)
    Started tv-grid (file-watch://track/grid) (source: broadcast.yaml:64)
    Started tv-race-control (file-watch://race-control) (source: broadcast.yaml:76)
    Started tv-podium (file-watch://track/areas/podium) (source: broadcast.yaml:108)
    Started tv-commercials (direct://commercial) (source: broadcast.yaml:145)
----

NOTE: Notice the new route `tv-commercials` is now also included in the process.

Under our new contractual terms, our obligation is to show a few commercials during the race.

Inject a commercial with the command below:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd send broadcast --uri direct:commercial \
--body "Integration race? Camel laps the competition"
----

or try out:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd send broadcast --uri direct:commercial \
--body "JBang it. Instant Camel. Instant win."
----

NOTE: `cmd send` is a command to send a message with Camel JBang: `broadcast` is the target process, `direct:commercial` is the target endpoint in that process, `--body` defines the message (the commercial content) to send.

Ads will be shown to audiences watching the race.

TIP: Be considerate with the amount of commercials you show. Overloading drops viewer retention.

=== Get race statistics

Follow race stats like number of laps, race duration, sector times with the `get` command:

[source,bash]
----
camel get route track --short-uri
----

NOTE: The command indicates to monitor route data from the `track` process.

TIP: You can hook the command using the `--watch` flag for continuous monitoring of the race progress (*Ctrl+C* to stop).

You should see lines like:

.Example output
----
99656  track  signals  file-watch://race-control    x     Started  3m18s    2/2   0.00      6     0         0     1     0     5     0     -1  32m15s/32m15s/-
99656  track  sector1  file://track/s1              x     Started  3m18s    2/2   0.00     12     0         0  5070  4098  6000  4274  -1634          7s/3s/-
99656  track  sector2  file://track/s2              x     Started  3m18s    2/2   0.00     12     0         2  5008  4071  6005  4745   +164         3s/11s/-
99656  track  sector3  file://track/s3              x     Started  3m18s    3/5   0.00     12     0         0  4946  4408  5988  4300   -155        11s/7s/-
----

NOTE: The example above shows the duration of the race so far, number of laps completed, and best sector times (in milliseconds).

=== Last lap

The on-track battle is heating up and laps are flying by quickly. Drivers are running out of time as the race is almost over.

As the race director, you need to signal the last lap:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd send race-control --uri direct:directive --body last-lap
----

Watch the cars cross the finish line:

.Example output
----
[       ]        |         |         |         |  Last lap!
[       ]        | 🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |         |
[       ]        | 🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |         |
[       ]        |         | 🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |
[       ]        |         | 🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |         |
[       ]        |         |         | 🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |
[       ]        |         |         | 🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶ |
[       ]        |         |         |         | 🏁 🐪‾ō͡≡o˞̶ 🏆
[       ]        |         |         |         | 🏁 🐎‾ō͡≡o˞̶
----

... and *Camel Racing* WINS !!!!!!

NOTE: Notice in the example above *teamCamel* making a move on *teamCavallino* in the last turns to take the trophy home.

=== Fascinating radio messages

Have a look at the radio messages transmitted from the teams to their drivers.

Below you can see the last radio transmissions when drivers crossed the finish line:

.Example output
----
Received Message: (5)
  Endpoint  file-watch://radio
  Body      (java.io.File) (size: 43 bytes: 41)
  🐪 Absolutely amazing! You're the WINNER!
Received Message: (6)
  Endpoint  file-watch://radio
  Body      (java.io.File) (size: 46 bytes: 44)
  🐎 Awesome drive! great result for the team.
----

=== Watch the winners lift the trophy

What a fabulous race! A crowd gathers around the podium area, hurry up, leave your seat in the stands and join them to see the champions lift the trophy.

image::images/track-podium.png[width=15%]

The crowd is going wild as the winners lift the trophy.

Did you see the winners lift the trophy? Good! The race was a success and the winners are celebrating their victory.

== Packing and closing down

It's time to pack up and close down the track.

This is generally not fun for teams and track personnel, there's a lot of work involved. But not with *_Camel JBang_*, letting you finish and wrap up very quickly with this nifty command!

[source,bash]
----
camel stop
----

NOTE: With no name, _Camel JBang_ stops all running Camel processes.

You should see the logs from the track and teams:

.Example output
----
Shutting down Camel integration (PID: 4234)
Shutting down Camel integration (PID: 4890)
Shutting down Camel integration (PID: 7544)
Shutting down Camel integration (PID: 8680)
Shutting down Camel integration (PID: 9077)
Shutting down Camel integration (PID: 9448)
----

TIP: Run `camel ps` to confirm all running processes have been stopped.

=== Stop listening for radio messages

Where your radio messages are displayed, press *Ctrl+C* to stop receiving transmissions.

=== Clean up your lab folder

Make sure your `lab` folder stays clean in preparation for your next lab exercises.

Run the command below (from your `lab` directory):

[source,bash]
----
rm -r *
----

Your `lab` folder should contain no files or directories.

Is your `lab` folder empty? Get ready to start working!

== Closing words

This was a fun introduction to Camel JBang, a tool that allows you to quickly prototype and test integrations.

Let's do a quick review of the types of commands you learned about in this lab:

*For running Camel, how to:*

* Run integrations
* Run them in the background
* Run them in *dev* mode (hot reload)
* Run them with properties

*For troubleshooting/monitoring, how to:*

* List running instances
* Start/Stop routes in process
* Make live code changes (dev mode)
* Get route statistics
* Send messages to endpoints
* Receive message with consumers

*For stopping Camel, how to:*

* Stop single instance
* Stop all processes

Continue exploring other examples to discover what _Camel JBang_ can do beyond this intro, and how it fits with other tools for working quickly with _Apache Camel_.
