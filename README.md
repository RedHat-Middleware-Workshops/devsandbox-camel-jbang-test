# A Day In the Life of a Camel developer

## Camel Workshop

This workshop presents an exciting real-world base scenario, where you will be the _Camel_ developer.

You will complete a series of exercises, ranging from simple data flows to medium and advanced use cases, fully event driven with daily data-backup processing enabled with Red Hat's Data Foundation.

The lab is very easy to follow and delivers great value on each step the student completes.

<br/>

### Audience

Developers, Architects, Data and Application Integrators

<br/>

### Prerequisites

- Camel
- Streams for Apache Kafka
- OpenShift 4.x
- OpenShift Data Foundation

<br/>

### Duration

Completing the workshop takes approximately 90 minutes plus 20 mins of slides introducing the content.

<br/>

### Provisioning Time

This workshop should be available after 60-75 minutes. It could fortuitously fail in the deployment, please just try again as it could be fixed already. If it takes more than 3 attempts, please do raise a ticket here: http://red.ht/rhpds-help 

Relevant information about the environment is sent in the final email.

<br/>

## Workshop Modules 

For now, the workshop only contains one module of exercises. New modules will be added to the workshop in the future, also covering _Camel_ functionality.

<br/>

## Camel JBang – First steps

The full walkthrough for getting started with _Camel JBang_ is in the repo:

**[Camel JBang - First steps](docs/labs/intro-cjbang/walkthrough.md)**

Familiarise yourself with the prototyping tool helping you to run, iterate and test your Camel applications. _Camel JBang_ is a command-line interface (CLI) that accelerates prototyping by letting developers quickly create, validate, and tweak flows without complex setups, making it perfect for rapid experimentation.
